# 1. Create a list with at least three numbers on it

a = [4675467, 456457, 45345657]

# 2. compare the first and last number in your list and store the resulting boolean in a variable

b = a[0] < a[2]

# 3. write an if statement that uses your boolean from step 2. if it's true print out a happy message otherwise print out a sad one

if b:
    print('b is True')

else:
    print('b is false')
